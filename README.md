# ngGridify
A quick html page that demonstrates sorting tables with AngularJS. I've started the library from full form, with the intention to check in finally as a component, with checkins along the way to demonstrate from simple to more advanced :)

Examples included in this repo, but to install just.....

npm install ng-gridify
